		I have been playing video games my entire life. From street figther with my dad (he felt great winning against a toddler and nows hes scared to play me) to minecraft 
		with my friends. I have always played games. Games to me are a form of teaching and learning. To most who do not play games it would be seen as a waste of time but,
		playing games has genuinally taught me many lessons. You have to know how to adapt, you have to know how to communicate, and most importantly, you have to want to win.
		The competitivness that i have devoloped through my life has not just come from sports but also my drive and ability to win when i play video games.
