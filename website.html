    <p class="sport"; style="font-size: 24px";> Playing basketball and soccer have helped me devolp the type of person i am. From learning to be a team player to striviing for personal growth in myself as a leader, 
    the hobbie of playing thses sports is something that im truly passionate about. Being able to see the world through the eyes of an athelete and keep a competetive edge to 
    myself helps me take that ethic on and off the court or field. Being able to devise strategies that can help me apprach different problems has helped me build a unique outlook
    on life and how i solve problems as a whole. </p>

    <p id="Section-Programming" style="font-size: 24px";>  Programming to me is a language and an art. It is a form of communicating to a computer the art you want to show the world. I have been interested in computers and programming
    since i was young. From playing video games to coding my own game, computer science in general has always been something i knew i wanted to dedicate my life too. To some that
    sort of dedication is hard but programming being something i enjoy makes the work feel like fun. MY passion and strive to reach my goals is something that makes people feel
    like they can relie on me for any team project i have and it also makes most feel comfortable with what i want to communicate to the world through programming </p>

    <p id="Section-Future" style="font-size: 24px";> My personal future goal is to build my own company. I want to create different types of video games and sell them to the world. My mission is to mkae games that everyone of 
    all ages can enjoy and are drawn towards what they can do in the game. I want to inspire more people to want to create their own game as it can lead to them telling their 
    own story.  </p>
