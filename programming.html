		Programming has been apart of my life for as long as i can remember. Since elementary school i have always had a connection with STEM technology and putting anything together. 
		Once i was in middle school it was an easy choice to take a programming class. In that class i built a deep love for what felt to me like i was creating. From my first infinite running game to creating entire quizes, 
		if felt easy for me to just make more. Currently in highschool I am enrolled into a 2 year programm to get certificates of programming while also learning multiple languages of code.
		In the future i hope to attend a 4 year college or university and enroll in computer Science to keep this passion going.
